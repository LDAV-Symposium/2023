# Keynote

**Machine Learning for Large Scale Scientific Data Analysis and Visualization**<br/>
_Professor Han-Wei Shen, The Ohio State University, USA_

In this talk, I will discuss several of our recent developments on using machine learning for scientific data analysis and visualization. I will primarily focus on three directions that we have seen some promising results: visualization surrogates, latent representations for scientific data, and methods that optimize the scientific visualization pipeline. I will first discuss how visualization surrogates can help streamline the visualization and analysis of large-scale ensemble simulations and facilitate the exploration of their immense input parameter space. Three different approaches for constructing such visualization surrogates: image space, object space, and hybrid image-object space approaches will be discussed. Then I will discuss how neural networks can be used to extract succinct representations from scientific data for rapid exploration and tracking of features. The use of geometric convolution to represent 3D particle data, and how regions of interest can be used as important measures for more efficient latent generation
will be discussed. Finally, I will describe how reinforcement learning can be used for automatic load balancing of parallel particle tracing, and how super-resolution architectures can be used for efficient representations of scalar and vector scientific data.
